# Description
LiveFilter is a jQuery plugin that can be used to sort lists of data in realtime, as you type.

# How to Use
LiveFilter expects your list to use a certain HTML structure. It can be used on ordered/unordered lists and tables. Your list must reside inside of a div that the plugin will be targeting. An example of the structure is below.

```html
<div id="wrapping_div">
	<input class="filter" type="text" value="" />
	<input class="reset" type="reset" value="Reset!" />
	<ul>
		<li>List Item</li>
		<li>List Item</li>
		<li>List Item</li>
		<li>List Item</li>
		<li>List Item</li>
		<li>List Item</li>
	</ul>
</div>
```

If your list follows the proper structure like above, you can then call the `liveFilter()` function on the wrapping div like so.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
	$('#wrapping_div').liveFilter();
</script>
````

If you need custom settings you can set them like this.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
	$('#wrapping_div').liveFilter({
		delay: 300, 
		defaultText: 'Custom Default Text:',
		zebra: {
			enabled: true,
			baseColor: '#13345d',
			altColor: '#174175'
		}
	});
</script>
```
